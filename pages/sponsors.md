### FAQ:

**Q**: If my company chooses to sponsor, how will this help my company collect leads?

**A**: Companies can collect leads by raffling off prizes. Sponsor logos can be hyperlinked to a special url (provided to us by the sponsor) where training attendees can enter their information to be entered into the raffle. Companies get to collect leads and attendees are entered into the drawing to win some really great prizes. Amazon gift cards are a popular prize and super easy to distribute to the winner. 

**Donations in other amounts are welcomed and certainly appreciated!**
