  Title: Defense-in-depth engineering (1-day training course 9am-5pm November 16)

  Description: >-
      The 2021 OWASP Top Ten introduced a category “Insecure Design” to focus on risks related to design flaws. In this training, we will focus on building defense-in-depth software. What can we do to proactively architect software to be more resilient to attacks? What type of findings may not be discovered via automated static analysis? How can we design our software to be more friendly during incident response scenarios?

      This one-day training is perfect for engineers as well as security practitioners that have some familiarity with the OWASP top 10. During this training, we will focus on identifying often-overlooked architectural anti-patterns and vulnerabilities to be on the lookout for. We will utilize source code review to analyze patterns for improvement in both real-world applications as well as intentionally vulnerable applications. Every interactive exercise will involve discovering concerns and writing code to engineer solutions. The course will wrap up with real-world vulnerability analysis of open-source software with an effort to help provide more secure architectural recommendations for these projects.


      Engineers will leave this training with a solid understanding of defense-in-depth software architecture and design. Security engineers or consultants can expect to leave with an increased understanding of insecure design patterns and vulnerabilities.<br>

  Description: >-
      You're tasked with 'doing AppSec' for your company and you've got more apps and issues than you know how to deal with.  This training course will help you make sense of the chaos and all with open source projects from OWASP at DevSecOps speeds.  This two-day hands-on course consists of a series of lectures and corresponding labs which demonstrate practical use of OWASP projects based on past use in real AppSec teams.  Knowing that AppSec team size is usually the most critical constraint, the training will cover how to automate the repetitive things allowing you to spend time on things that require the human brain.  Be prepared to return to your company with a whole new arsenal of tools and techniques to make your AppSec efforts more successful by adding automation and OWASP projects running at the speed of DevSecOps.  With over 20+ years of experience, the trainer provides pragmatic and well-tested advice on being successful rather than theoretical 'best practices'.<br>

  Description: >-
       You bought the application security tools, you have the findings, but now what? Many organizations find themselves drowning in “possible vulnerabilities”, struggling to streamline their processes and not sure how to measure their progress.

        If you are involved in using SAST, DAST or SCA tools in your organization, these may be familiar feelings to you. In this course you will learn how to address these problems and more (in a vendor-neutral way), with topics including:
        ●	What to expect from these tools?
        ●	Customizing and optimizing these tools effectively
        ●	Building tool processes which fit your business
        ●	Automating workflows using CI/CD without slowing it down.
        ●	Showing the value and improvements you are making
        ●	Faster and easier triage through smart filtering
        ●	How to focus on fixing what matters and cut down noise
        ●	Techniques for various alternative forms of remediation
        ●	Building similar processes for penetration testing activities.
        ●	Comparison of the different tool types covered.

        To bring the course to life and let you apply what you learn, you will work in teams on table-top exercises where you design processes to cover specific scenarios, explain and justify your decisions to simulated stakeholders and practice prioritizing your remediation efforts.
        
        For these exercises, you will work based on specially designed process templates (which we will provide) which you can use afterwards to apply these improvements within your own organization.
        
        Be ready to work in a group, take part in discussions and present your findings and leave the course with clear strategies and ideas on how to get less stress and more value from these tools.
