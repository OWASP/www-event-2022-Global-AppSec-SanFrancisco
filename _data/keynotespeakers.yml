  bio: >-
      Dr. Charlie Miller is "one of the most technically proficient hackers on Earth", according to Foreign Policy. After receiving his 
      PhD in Mathematics from the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Miller was a computer hacker for the National Security Agency for five years. 
      Since that time he has worked for the Twitter application security team, as well as worked on the autonomous vehicle security teams for
      Uber, Didi Chuxing, and currently Cruise Automation. He has won the “Super Bowl” of computer hacking, the annual Pwn2Own competition 
      four times. Dr. Miller has found countless vulnerabilities in a number of Apple products including their laptops and phones. Perhaps the 
      most notorious of these issues was the ability to remotely compromise an iPhone by merely sending it a malicious text message. He is 
      known as the first to remotely exploit the iPhone when it was released as well as the first Android phone when it was released (on the 
      day it came out). Lately, Dr. Miller has spent considerable time in the field of automotive security. Dr. Miller demonstrated that a 
      variety of Fiat Chrysler vehicles could be remotely hacked from anywhere in the country and he could control the radio, brakes, wipers, 
      transmission, acceleration, and even the steering of the target vehicle. The demonstration of these vulnerabilities led to the recall of 
      1.4 million vehicles. Dr. Miller has been featured on the Today Show, ABC World News Tonight, CNN, NPR, CNBC, New York Times, USA Today, 
      Forbes, etc.
  subject: A lifetime of vulnerabilities
  abstract: Throughout his career, Charlie has discovered a number of significant (and not so significant) vulnerabilities in products.  In this talk, he will discuss some of his favorite vulnerabilities along with the stories of their discovery and disclosure.  While these anecdotes will be lighthearted, real lessons can be learned from them on how to secure your products as well as how to deal with the inevitable discovery of vulnerabilities in them.

  subject: Construction work ahead: a lesson in paving paths for Security
  abstract: >-
       In this talk, we’ll discuss scaling security programs through technology and secure-by-defaults in an evolving engineering ecosystem. We’ll share lessons learned from “paving roads” for security over the years, how to find opportunities, create shared accountability with engineering partners, and ultimately reduce security risks.

  subject: The Abridged History of OWASP and Application Security
  abstract: Application Security began in the early '60s, when plaintext password storage, poor password policies, poor access control, weak or non-existent cryptography, and other massive security problems were the norm. This talk will review the history of application security and OWASP to help illustrate how much application security has gotten better and how the rate of positive change has been getting better over the past 60 years. This fun ride through the history of application security will help inspire those who work in this very stressful security industry. Security professionals often look closely at failure and insecurity as part of their work, which can be exhausting on many levels. But when we look at our industry historically, we can all see how genuinely things are improving.

  subject: Building a security program No buzzwords allowed
  abstract: In a world full of magic quadrants, acronyms, slicing and dicing of security product market share let’s go back to basics and discuss building and maturing a security program with a focus on foundational building blocks. Let’s put the buzzwords, tools overload aside and talk about the mammoth task of securing applications, building a team,failing and hopefully maturing along the way. It’s gonna be a ride!
